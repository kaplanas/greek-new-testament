# Greek New Testament: syntactic parsing for learners

These scripts do some basic syntactic parsing of the Greek New Testament in order to extract segments that are accessible to early learners, using only the constructions they've been exposed to so far.

The morphological parsing of [James Tauber](https://github.com/morphgnt/sblgnt) is used as a base.

The parsed LXX (used to populate some principal parts) comes from [katabiblon.com](https://en.katabiblon.com/us/index.php?text=LXX].
