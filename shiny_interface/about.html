<h2>What is this site?</h2>

<p>This site is a tool for people who are learning New Testament Greek.</p>

<p>The early stages of learning a language can be frustrating because you're excited to use the language but don't know very much yet.  This is especially true if your goal is to read the New Testament in Greek; it takes a long time before you're prepared to read authentic passages, even short ones.</p>

<p>The goal of this site is to encourage students on their Greek journey by showing them authentic excerpts from the New Testament from the very beginning.</p>

<h2>How do I use this site?</h2>

<p>Check the grammatical constructions you know so far in the "Current knowledge" tab.  The "Excerpts" tab will show phrases taken directly from the New Testament – no editing whatsoever – that consist <em>only</em> of forms you already know.  Early on, these phrases will be extremely short – often just two words.  (The site won't show single words unless the sentence itself is only one word long.)  But the excerpts are real!  You could pick up a Greek New Testament and find exactly that phrase in the text.</p>

<p>If you aren't sure what a specific checkbox means, hover over it to see a short definition or example.  This isn't a comprehensive tutorial; the goal is to give you enough information to determine whether this is a construction you've already learned, possibly by a different name.  If the explanation doesn't make sense, this is probably something you haven't learned yet!  (I've tried to use terminology that has a good chance to be broadly understood, but I'm happy to receive feedback on this.)</p>

<p>The "Excerpts" tab follows the rule that <em>no</em> word in the list has a property you haven't checked off.  If you want to see examples of verbs, you'll need to select at least one verb class, at least one voice, and at least one tense/mood combination.  To see examples of nouns, you'll need to select at least one case and at least one noun class type.</p>

<p>The site doesn't let you filter by vocabulary; that would severely limit the excerpts you see.  (Also, at some point it would be extremely tedious to check off all the words you know!)  Instead, the "Lexicon" tab displays definitions of all the words currently in the "Excerpts" tab.</p>

<p>The "Excerpts" tab also lets you filter by specific grammatical constructions.  If you want to see examples of the instrumental dative, choose that option from the drop-down menu; the list will be filtered to excerpts that have at least one example of the instrumental dative.  (If a construction doesn't appear in the menu, that's because none of the excerpts you can currently read have that construction.)</p>

<h2>Can I get parses of individual words?</h2>

<p>Not currently.  There are other sites, like <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/" target="_blank">Blue Letter Bible</a>, that already do this very well.  This site aims to fill a very specific niche: to introduce students, as early as possible, to the experience of reading portions of the New Testament with just their brains and a dictionary.</p>

<h2>Why do I have to log in with my email?</h2>

<p>So the site can remember what you've checked in the "Current knowledge" tab next time you log in.  That's the only reason.</p>

You can email me at kaplanas@gmail.com.  I'll do my best to answer promptly – but this site is a hobby project; if life is happening, I may not be able to respond right away.
